While I understand that there are concerns about automation potentially leading to job losses, I personally don't believe that avoiding technological advancement is a viable solution. If society had taken that stance during the industrial revolution, we would have never seen the progress that benefits us today. Of course, I fully recognize the ethical dilemmas that come with automation and AI, but I believe there are ways to manage these challenges through thoughtful policies and ethical frameworks. The solution isn't to stop progress but rather to guide it in a direction that benefits both individuals and society as a whole.
